Attached files are sample code from a few software development classes. I gained experience building class diagrams, 
to form classes in java, and also creating interactive webpages built from jsp. Other projects for class or for fun include solving a minesweeper board or playing tic-tac-toe against an AI that will never lose.

The project code for the webpages will not be able to be ran as we used data from an SQL Database 
in which I no longer have access to. However, with the other code I hope you will be able to gain a viewpoint in my capabilities. 

These projects taught different styles of coding. We used a mixture of java as well as java script, python, and C.

I would select the following projects for a sample: 
MineSweeperStarter
HillClimbing
TicTacStarter
